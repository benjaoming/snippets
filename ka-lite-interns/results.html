I have played on both sides of the field, being the student and the teacher. My passion for learning and teaching began early, in the seventh grade when I began tutoring at after school programs at the YMCA. I spent day after day, hour after hour, helping the children study for their exams, do their homework, and work with educational games. I always felt so accomplished, because I got so much more done with the children than any of the adults were able to do. I had this feeling of being important to these children in such a crucial aspect of their lives. Not only did I help the students, but I gained so much more. <br/>        Flash forward to this quarter of my collegiate career, and here I am again as a classroom intern at Gomper's Preparatory Academy. Now, my emphasis is on tutoring and program implementation with the special education students. These students are able to learn mostly through their computers, because of the growing age of technology. The amount of time they are able to focus on their Khan Academy math lessons is exponential, compared to their abilities when I try to teach them with more traditional methods. <br/>        With everything that I have experienced going through these two programs, I have realized the importance of education. With the YMCA, I realized I was helping the children build a foundation for a fruitful, limitless life, where a lack of education would never hold them back. With Gomper's Preparatory Academy, I am helping these students find ways to learn that work best with each of their individual needs, and no longer are they being held back, but rather propelled into the future with the skills they need to function on their own. Never have I seen a more fundamental need to a human than the need for education. Never have I witnessed a child happier than one who realizes that they are capable of what ever they set their mind to. Never have I felt such a strong passion for something that I feel should be shared with the world. <br/>        I would like to work with the Foundation for Learning Equality because I believe these are the people that understand the passion I have, and see the potential that I see. There is so much that humanity is missing out on as a whole, simply because free education is not universal, and unfortunately in some cases is nearly impossible. I want to work with the Foundation for Learning Equality to ensure that no child, teen, or adult for that matter is ever held back by his or her inability to find free and safe education. There is nothing more valuable to the individual than the acquisition of knowledge, and therefore there is nothing that society could benefit from more. As Montaigne would state, "It is better to have a well-formed mind rather than a well-filled mind," and I believe that the Foundation for Learning Equality is the first step for ensuring this balance within all people. </p>        <h2>Tell us about yourself</h2>        <p>I feel like I really have done just a little bit of everything. I have been a tutor for children with special needs, and children enrolled in general education. I have been a co-founder for a non-profit organization that supports a shelter for sex-trafficked women. I played softball for thirteen years of my life. I have designed a small correlational study within one of my Cognitive Science classes, using surveys and employing different methods of statistical analysis. And, I spent eight months of my life working in the fast food industry, and definitely taking a different outlook on life because of that. As far as all of those things go, I feel really fortunate. I have had many opportunities to work on improving myself, while also having opportunities to improve life for others. I suppose there is nothing more that I could really ask for, or any of us could really ask for for that matter. <br/>        Overall, I would consider myself an extremely positive person. It's unbelievably rare to find me in a sour or stressed mood, mostly because I'm insane with my organizational skills, and really intent on prioritization and list-making. I'm great at keeping myself calm and focused and I've realized that my attitudes about that have really influenced the people around me. I see all challenges as opportunities to improve something or someone, and I feel really good about that. I can see that my positivity really can be contagious to others, and when I realize that I made a positive impact on someone else's week, or day, or minute, I feel like I have accomplished something. Life is really good, and it's really beautiful when people can take a step back and just understand how wonderful everything that surrounds us really is. <br/>        This question is asking me about who I am, and I'm still young and without a definition for this question. I'm hoping, however, that there will never be a day when I come across a definition for myself, and that I will possibly never be able to answer this question. I really enjoy the whole developmental process of humans, and I find that the less I label myself and those around me, the more I am able to really flourish, push myself, and see the best in others. We're all just trying to hold on to this crazy ride together, and I think that if we're all able to work together, with positive, infectious attitudes, we'll all end up as good and as defined as we were ever meant to be. </p>        <h3>Additional items: </h3>        <p><strong>Link to online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Link to online resume or linkedIn</strong>: Will Email </p>        <p><strong>A list of 3 things you'd improve about either of our sites</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Links to any live projects, past projects, your GitHub account and/or online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Photoshop/GIMP]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Illustrator/Inkscape]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Visual Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [User Experience Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [HTML]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [CSS/LESS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [JS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Python]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Django]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Git]</strong>: </p>            <h1>Name: Ly, Victoria</h1>        <h2>Email: ly.victoria@yahoo.com</h2>        <h2>Position: Research & Implementations Intern</h2>        <h2>Cover Letter:</h2>        <p>I am interested in broadening my education and experiences by becoming part of a creative and dynamic team at Foundation for Learning Equality. I've taken courses over the year at UC San Diego that revolved around cognitive ethnography, rapid contextual design, heuristic evaluations, and user experience and user interaction research. I enjoy being able to apply materials and techniques I learned in an academic setting to real-world projects. I hope that with this internship, I can hone my skills and further develop my digital intuition.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the focus of Foundation for Learning Equality is very close to my heart. I am passionate about education for all; I love to learn and feel knowledge is truly a success in life. I am part of a National Honor Fraternity, Phi Sigma Pi and our national philanthropy is Teach for America. I am well acquainted with the goals of educational equality and strongly believe it is a mission in which everyone can easily partake. I am excited to have an opportunity to use design to solve bigger problems in the world. <br/><br/>I enjoy working with people; there are so many things to learn simply by observing people's actions and behaviors. I am extremely detail-oriented. I believe excellent organizational skills is a habit and overall lends itself as a cognitive shortcut. I am always looking for opportunities for personal growth and I believe Foundation for Learning Equality is a great way to achieve this goal. <br/></p>        <h2>Tell us about yourself</h2>        <p>I am studying Cognitive Science and Human Computer Interaction at the University of California - San Diego. I love the internet, art, and technology. On the weekends, I enjoy brewing tea, going on hikes, running half marathons, riding my fixed gear, and exploring different communities in Southern California. <br/><br/>In regards to my experience with UX/UI research, I worked on three different academic projects over the last year and walked away with invaluable knowledge. For more information on individual projects and how I contributed to them, please refer to my resume. Some of my favorite processes during these projects were: collecting user feedback (and creating an affinity diagram) and creating user-centered design ideas. I enjoy being able to rapidly create new, abstract, and obscure design ideas based on my research. <br/><br/>I enjoy reading articles on design and always make an effort to update myself on what is trending for web designs, on Photoshop and Illustrator, and typography. Above all, I enjoy going to Barnes & Nobel and browsing books that could broaden my keen eye for design. My main design philosophies, which are credited to my Human Computer Interaction professors, are: good design is invisible and the last 10% of my work requires 90% of my effort. <br/><br/>On a different note, I have an extensive book of life philosophies and I try to follow them everyday, one day at a time. The one that is most pertinent to me today is to help the world be less serious; I believe enthusiasm and a positive attitude is contagious. I work hard to maintain my reputation as a reliable, personable, cultured, and trustworthy being. </p>        <h3>Additional items: </h3>        <p><strong>Link to online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Link to online resume or linkedIn</strong>: https://www.dropbox.com/s/j6bs02ip5vsdtbi/RESUME_VLY_2014.pdf</p>        <p><strong>A list of 3 things you'd improve about either of our sites</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Links to any live projects, past projects, your GitHub account and/or online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Photoshop/GIMP]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Illustrator/Inkscape]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Visual Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [User Experience Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [HTML]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [CSS/LESS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [JS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Python]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Django]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Git]</strong>: </p>            <h1>Name: Klein, Josh</h1>        <h2>Email: jdklein@ucsd.edu</h2>        <h2>Position: Research & Implementations Intern</h2>        <h2>Cover Letter:</h2>        <p>I want to begin by thanking you for the opportunity to apply for this position. When I heard that the company that created KA Lite was not only born out of UCSD, but also looking into hiring interns as well, I knew that I had to be a part of such an incredible company. I feel that given both who I am and what I can do for FLE, I will be a very beneficial asset to your team.<br/><br/>Coming from a moral standpoint, I believe that education today is handled extremely poorly. Education is skewed only towards those that can afford it, while those that can't remain ignorant to the vast amount of human knowledge available. Because education brings with it greater income potential, this of course results in a vicious circle of only the educated being able to afford education for future generations. I believe that education should be a right for everyone, not a privilege of the rich. It is for this reason that I find the Foundation for Learning Equality somewhere I see myself being a part of.<br/><br/>Now, coming from a business standpoint, I feel that I fit the position perfectly. Having taken courses in interpersonal relations and professional communication, I pride myself on my communication skills. These were particularly utilized in my previous position as a User Experience Analyst at Strathspey Crown, LLC, where I was involved in daily communication between developers, project managers, and users of our app, ShoutMD. I was required to stay up-to-date with each timeline, wireframe, version, etc. and maintain all revisions on a weekly basis in a spreadsheet. Though during my time there I utilized the Microsoft suite of products, I am also well-versed in Google's apps, such as Google Spreadsheet.<br/><br/>As a User Experience Analyst, I was also able to take a look at the back-end, quantitative side of User Experience Design that I had previously had little experience with. This involved utilizing dashboards to look into user statistics such as log-ins, crashes, popular areas of the app, etc. to gain a better feel for what was going right, or wrong, with ShoutMD. With this knowledge, alongside communicating with users of the app who encountered any difficulties with it, I was able to ideate on ways to improve the app's usability. Having a basic background in Java, HTML5, and CSS allows to me to think like a programmer, while having experience with programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Axure allows me to execute my thoughts rapidly. This resulted in near-daily ideas on how to improve ShoutMD, many of which ended up being implemented (such as personalized welcome messages and changes to overall UI).<br/><br/>In summary, I have both a passion for education and ideation. Together, I find myself a perfect fit for the position of Research & Implementations Intern. I am eager to hear back from you.<br/><br/>Josh Klein<br/>UCSD<br/>Cognitive Science, Human-Computer Interaction B.S. Candidate</p>        <h2>Tell us about yourself</h2>        <p>My favorite quote, and personal philosophy, comes from Shakespeare's "As You Like It" - "All the world's a stage, / And all the men and women merely players." When I was younger, this quote once brought me into existential peril, but I find myself today looking at it in a more positive light. I now take life extremely light-heartedly and optimistically, always looking to bring only positive energy with me. I tend to be very philosophical, and catch myself thinking about the "big questions" such as existence, purpose, morality, etc. In my free time, I enjoy ballroom dance, rock climbing, hiking, reading, and playing with small, furry animals.</p>        <h3>Additional items: </h3>        <p><strong>Link to online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Link to online resume or linkedIn</strong>: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/josh-klein/69/745/682</p>        <p><strong>A list of 3 things you'd improve about either of our sites</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Links to any live projects, past projects, your GitHub account and/or online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Photoshop/GIMP]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Illustrator/Inkscape]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Visual Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [User Experience Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [HTML]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [CSS/LESS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [JS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Python]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Django]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Git]</strong>: </p>            <h1>Name: Van, Ellen</h1>        <h2>Email: elvan@ucsd.edu</h2>        <h2>Position: Research & Implementations Intern</h2>        <h2>Cover Letter:</h2>        <p>I am exceptionally pleased to submit my resume for the internship position with The Foundation for Learning Equality. <br/><br/>Coming from a low-income preparatory high school, where their program embraced the idea of one student at a time, I was privileged to have had the resources to access a higher education. My high school offered the opportunity for students to become independent and prepare them for the challenges of post-high school studies. I realize that their program was essential to my success at UCSD because it provided the necessary resources to help me grow as a learner. The program was designed to embrace the ideas of intercultural understanding, social responsibility, and an inter-disciplinary emphasis. Through my experiences, I realized the importance of breaking down barriers for the under-represented students from low socio-economic backgrounds.  It is important to be part of an environment where student are surrounded by positively and motivation. Being in a program that encourages student to continue on to higher education makes me realize how lucky I am to be surrounded by people that care for my success.  Because of my experiences in high school and college, I would like to be part of an environment where I can work with others to make education be more accessible to everyone in the world. <br/>	<br/>I could contribute to the position as a Research & Implementations Intern, because I have strong organizational skills, effective productivity habits, and a sense of discipline to keep myself on track.  Self-management skill is essential when working on a self-initiate project. I have worked on several self-initiated project before where I collaborated with the business manager to discuss the possible projects I can do. The projects I have done included creating education brochures that would be useful for patients and creating an efficient system to organize patient files. Furthermore, from my experiences with APSA high school conference, I learned the importance of communication and working with a partner. I have come to understand how to support and learn from others in order to work effectively and cooperatively to accomplish a task. I am a goal-derived person that knows that effective action depends on the ability to focus your attention where it is needed most.  If given the opportunity, I look forward to display some of my skills as well as strength some of my weaknesses with the help of my peers.<br/><br/>I would be privileged to be part of The Foundation for Learning Equality team, as I know that I will be challenge and have the opportunity to work on my goal of helping the community. <br/></p>        <h2>Tell us about yourself</h2>        <p></p>        <h3>Additional items: </h3>        <p><strong>Link to online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Link to online resume or linkedIn</strong>: Will email resume</p>        <p><strong>A list of 3 things you'd improve about either of our sites</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Links to any live projects, past projects, your GitHub account and/or online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Photoshop/GIMP]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Illustrator/Inkscape]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Visual Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [User Experience Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [HTML]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [CSS/LESS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [JS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Python]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Django]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Git]</strong>: </p>            <h1>Name: Volodarskiy, Monica</h1>        <h2>Email: mvolodarskiy@hotmail.com</h2>        <h2>Position: Research & Implementations Intern</h2>        <h2>Cover Letter:</h2>        <p>My research and analytic skills, honed through my work at Senator Feinstein's office as a Research Intern and as VP Finance for Alpha Epsilon Phi, would greatly benefit the Foundation for Learning Equality and the goal of implementing KA Lite through multiple access points.

After my first year as a Peer College Counselor, I was asked to also call younger students in and speak to them about their grades, their future goals in life, etc. I have always been someone who is sure of her path, no matter how many different forks in the road present themselves to me. That job was one of my favorites because I felt that I was there for a greater purpose, which was to inspire people to gain a vision and a path for their lives. I still keep in contact with many of my peers who tell me their life choices are owing to the talks we would have during their Library Hours. <br/><br/>I became interested in Research and Data Analysis my senior year of high school, when I took a Business Statistics class. Using Excel every day, analyzing Stock Reports, researching both quantitative and qualitative data, interested me to the point that I decided to take a Business 101 college class that same year. I decided that my path is to go into Business, and I have been taking extra classes outside of my core courses in order to improve my knowledge, such as Financial Accounting. <br/><br/>My major of International Relations - Political Science with a secondary track in Communications came from a place of wanting to help society, specifically in the global context. My ultimate goal is to become involved globally using my skills in business - data analysis, research, etc. - and the skills I gain everyday through my major. <br/><br/>Besides school and my future goals for a career, I enjoy practicing yoga in my spare time and someday hope to travel to India or Bali and practice yoga as my sabbatical. On my off time, I envision myself going to the local schools and putting in several hours teaching the kids English, and whatever skills necessary. I am also a part of a sorority, Alpha Epsilon Phi, for which I became extremely involved in by joining my Executive Board as VP Finance. I hope to bring my sorority to an even greater position as a Panhellenic Sorority, and be recognized nationally for our success as a chapter. </p>        <h3>Additional items: </h3>        <p><strong>Link to online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Link to online resume or linkedIn</strong>: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/monica-volodarskiy/84/513/277</p>        <p><strong>A list of 3 things you'd improve about either of our sites</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Links to any live projects, past projects, your GitHub account and/or online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Photoshop/GIMP]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Illustrator/Inkscape]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Visual Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [User Experience Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [HTML]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [CSS/LESS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [JS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Python]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Django]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Git]</strong>: </p>            <h1>Name: Ramaswamy, Suvasini</h1>        <h2>Email: r.suvasini@gmail.com</h2>        <h2>Position: Grant Writing Intern</h2>        <h2>Cover Letter:</h2>        <p>In addition to a common nationality, I also share Gandhi's belief that we must be the change we want to bring in the world. <br/>Over the years, I have been looking for meaningful ways to use and expand my skills in trying to make a change.

From all these perspectives, the mission statement of Foundation for learning equality appeals to my sensibilities and it promises to be a place where I can make a difference. <br/></p>        <h2>Tell us about yourself</h2>        <p>As I mentioned above, I grew up in India and came to the United States for my post-doctoral research. I am a scientist by the day, working on cell therapy for the liver; but I also share a keen passion for the written word, which makes me an avid reader and blogger. I am a person with many interests ranging from art and photography to science writing. I am currently exploring interesting avenues to bring my different interests together in order to make a difference in the real world. <br/><br/>Academic research has been the fulcrum of my life for the past decade or two and this has limited my involvement with many interesting projects. However, I have previously dabbled in tutoring kids, adult literacy and have worked at a food kitchen. I am also hopeful of initiating some collaborative projects towards expanding health care opportunities in the developing world where I hope that my understanding of biology and academic research would come in handy. <br/><br/>As for my approach to life, I think it is constantly being shaped by my experiences. However I do see that my recent experiences in the States contrasted with my growing up years in India have made me acutely aware of the role of culture and society on human progress and well being. I have come to realize that while problems are usually solved at a rational level using logic and statistics, most solutions are only truly effective when they account for the subtle socio-cultural factors and individual quirks that make a big difference. <br/><br/>Finally, I hope to be useful to organizations such as yours by being a part of solutions than by merely identifying the problems of the world. <br/><br/><br/></p>        <h3>Additional items: </h3>        <p><strong>Link to online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Link to online resume or linkedIn</strong>: http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=95671743&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile_pic</p>        <p><strong>A list of 3 things you'd improve about either of our sites</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Links to any live projects, past projects, your GitHub account and/or online portfolio</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Photoshop/GIMP]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Illustrator/Inkscape]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Visual Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [User Experience Design Principles]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [HTML]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [CSS/LESS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [JS]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Python]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Django]</strong>: </p>        <p><strong>Rate your level of experience with the following tools/skills [Git]</strong>: </p>            <h1>Name: Raju, Phani</h1>        <h2>Email: phanirajuyn@gmail.com</h2>        <h2>Position: Front-End Web Development Intern</h2>        <h2>Cover Letter:</h2>        <p>I'm very passionate about education and outreach programs that make education accessible to everyone.

My goal was to motivate all 200 of the attendees to pursue higher education.
